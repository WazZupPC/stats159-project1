## The Easy Part:The easy part of this project is converting formats from Markdown file written in R and processed with Knitr.  This simple conversion is done by click the Knitr button on Rstudio.## The Challenging Part:The most challenging part of the project is collaboration. To do a reproducible workflow, a tiny change or bug would cause a mountain of work.  For example, some project teammate use WORD to produce manuscripts while others use LaTex. It’s very hard to interact or work with other who use different format editing. Sometimes, there is miscommunication between teammate. As a result, all of above would slow down the project process.## Resources UsedI utilized most of the online resources, including Google searches, Wikipedia pages and YouTube videos to search definition and tutorial of Makefile, Git, Github, Pandoc and Rmarkdown. I learned a lot of the technical knowledge that I did not know.## The most time consuming part：I spent 7 hours on this paper.The most time consuming part is writing this discussion and converting the legit definition of Git, Github, etc. into my own word. This part is especially challenging
