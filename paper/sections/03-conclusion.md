# Conclusion

From writing this paper, I have developed deeper understanding of how to utilize the computational tool such as Makefile, Git, Github, Pandoc and R Markdown to do a reproducible research. Before I was exposed to reproducible workflow, I was so afraid of doing a large project since the revision will be tedious and complicated. I am becoming more confident with collaboration and use of computational tool after learning reproducible workflow. It allows me to be familiar with those computational tool and take more advantage of it, which makes me to do the daily reproducible workflow more efficiently and smoothly.
