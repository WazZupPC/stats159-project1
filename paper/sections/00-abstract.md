# Abstract

Discussing the computational tool for producing reproducible research paper we so far learned in STAT-159 class. I commented on the use of Makefile, Git, Github, Pandoc and R Markdown about their roles and usefulness in reproducible workflow.The goal of this paper is to describe the experience the author using the computational tool above to produce a reproducible research paper. Through online searches and collaboration with teammates, I learned a lot about each term and would like to discuss some of my findings in this paper
